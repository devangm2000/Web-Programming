            The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus), a subspecies of the red junglefowl, is a type of domesticated
            fowl.
            Chickens are o̥̥ne of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7
            billion
            as of
            2018,[1] up from more than 19 billion in 2011.[2] There are more chickens in the world than any other
            bird.[2]
            Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and, less commonly,
            as
            pets.
            Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until the
            Hellenistic
            period (4th–2nd centuries BCE).

                    ̥̥Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East
                    Asia,[5]
                    but
                    the clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originated from the Indian
                    subcontinent.
                    From ancient India, the chicken spread to Lydia in western Asia Minor, and to Greece by the 5th
                    century
                    BCE.[6]
                    Fowl have been known in Egypt since the mid-15th century BCE, with the "bird that gives birth every
                    day"
                    having
                    come from the land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia, according to the annals of Thutmose III.
